## Your Performance-Focused Development Rig
A progressive theme development rig for WordPress, WP Rig is built to promote the latest best practices for progressive web content and optimization. Building a theme from WP Rig means adopting this approach and the core principles it is built on:
- Accessibility
- [Lazy-loading of images ](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/lazy-loading-guidance/images-and-video/)
- Mobile-first
- Progressive enhancement
- [Resilient Web Design](https://resilientwebdesign.com/)
- Progressive Web App enabled
- AMP-ready

## Installation
WP Rig has been tested on Linux, Mac, and Windows.

### Requirements
WP Rig requires the following dependencies. Full installation instructions are provided at their respective websites.

- [PHP](http://php.net/) 7.0
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) (installed globally)

### How to install WP Rig:
1. Clone or download this repository to the themes folder of a WordPress site on your development environment.
    - DO NOT change the name of the theme directory from the default `wprig`.
2. Configure theme settings, including the theme slug and name, in `./config/themeConfig.js`.
3. In command line, run `npm install` to install necessary node and Composer dependencies.
4. In command line, run `npm run build` to process source files and build the development theme.
5. In WordPress admin, activate the WP Rig development theme.

## How to build WP Rig for production:
1. Follow the steps above to install WP Rig.
2. Run `npm run bundle` from inside the `wp-rig` development theme.
3. A new, production ready theme will be generated in `wp-content/themes`.
4. The production theme can be activated or uploaded to a production environment.

### Wiki: Recommended code editor extensions
To take full advantage of the features in WP Rig, visit the [Recommended code editor extensions Wiki page](https://github.com/wprig/wprig/wiki/Recommended-code-editor-extensions).

## Working with WP Rig
WP Rig can be used in any development environment. It does not require any specific platform or server setup. It also does not have an opinion about what local or virtual server solution the developer uses.

Before first run, visit the [BrowserSync wiki page](https://github.com/wprig/wprig/wiki/BrowserSync).

### Available Processes

#### `dev watch` process
`npm run dev` will run the default development task that processes source files. While this process is running, source files will be watched for changes and the BrowserSync server will run. This process is optimized for speed so you can iterate quickly.

#### `dev build` process
`npm run build` processes source files one-time. It does not watch for changes nor start the BrowserSync server.

#### `translate` process
`npm run translate` generates a `.pot` file for the theme to enable translation. The translation file will be stored in `./languages/`.

#### `production bundle` process
`npm run bundle` generates a production ready theme as a new theme directory and, optionally, a `.zip` archive. This builds all source files, optimizes the built files for production, does a string replacement and runs translations. Non-essential files from the `wp-rig` development theme are not copied to the production theme.
To bundle the theme without creating a zip archive, change the `export:compress` setting in `./config/themeConfig.js`:

```javascript
export: {
	compress: false
}
```

### Gulp process
WP Rig uses a [Gulp 4](https://gulpjs.com/) build process to generate and optimize the code for the theme. All development is done in the `wp-rig` development theme. Feel free to edit any `.php` files. Asset files (CSS, JavaScript and images) are processed by gulp. You should only edit the source asset files in the following locations:
- CSS: `assets/css/src`
- JavaScript: `assets/js/src`
- images: `assets/images/src`

For more information about the Gulp processes, what processes are available, and how to run them individually, visit the [Gulp Wiki page](https://github.com/wprig/wprig/wiki/Gulp).

## Advanced Features
WP Rig gives the developer an out of the box environment with support for modern technologies including ES2015, CSS grid, CSS custom properties (variables), and existing tools like Sass without making any configurations. Just write code and WP Rig handles the heavy lifting for you.

Configuring the behavior of WP Rig is done by editing `./config/themeConfig.js`. Here the developer can set the theme name and theme author name (for translation files), the browser list for AutoPrefixer, and local server settings for BrowserSync. Additionally, compression of JavaScript and CSS files can be turned off for debugging purposes.

WP Rig ships with advanced features including:
- Lazy-loading images
- Built-in support for the [official AMP plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/)
- Progressive loading of CSS
- Modern CSS, custom properties (variables), autoprefixing, etc
- Modern layouts through CSS grid, flex, and float
